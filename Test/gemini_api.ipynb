    "**Summary:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The document details the design, construction, and testing of \"Ultraman,\" a robotic system for automated tribological testing in metal forming.  The system aims to improve accuracy and efficiency compared to existing manual methods. Ultraman consists of three sub-assemblies:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Structure & Heating:** A robust test frame with an integrated heater to simulate hot stamping conditions.\n",
    "2.  **Transmission & Robotics:** A UR10 robotic arm integrated with a pneumatic strip feeder for precise sample handling.\n",
    "3.  **Functional Blocks:** Modules for pin sample handling, grinding, and lubrication.\n",
    "\n",
    "The system uses a Python-based control system with integration of URscript and Arduino to automate the testing process.  Testing showed that the system met many of its key requirements, notably achieving improved accuracy in sample feeding.  However, some challenges were encountered, including issues with force control, achieving fully autonomous operation, and enhancing the feeding mechanism.  The project exceeded its budget by 17%, justified by its innovative nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommendations for Improving Accuracy:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the document's findings, here are recommendations to increase Ultraman's accuracy:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Improved Force Control:** The UR10 robot's force control did not perform as expected due to vibration and surface finish issues.  Implementing additional sensors (e.g., force/torque sensors, accelerometers) and refining the control algorithms could significantly improve accuracy in force application during scratching and other processes.  Adding better vibration dampening to the system would also help.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Enhanced Feeding Mechanism:** While the pneumatic strip feeder exceeded the desired sample feeding accuracy, issues with bowing of thinner samples were noted.  Consider implementing a 3-roll bender to flatten and re-coil the material, allowing for the use of rolled metal blanks, as suggested in the conclusion. The system should also be recalibrated more frequently.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Improved Sensor Integration:** The document suggests integrating all actuators (heater, fan, etc.) into the central control system for better coordination and efficiency.  This would also allow for data acquisition from various sensors which could be used for real-time feedback and adaptive control adjustments to further improve precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Addressing Vibration:** The system suffered from vibration, affecting force readings.  Implementing better vibration dampening measures in the system's design is crucial. This could include stiffer frame elements, more effective dampening materials, or more robust mounting mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Addressing Environmental Factors:** Factors such as air quality and lubricant dispersion can impact test results. Controlling the environment, using high-quality lubricants, and implementing more precise lubricant application mechanisms would improve consistency and repeatability.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Regular Calibration:** The document highlights the need for recalibrating the strip feeder regularly. Incorporating automatic calibration routines into the control system could improve long-term accuracy and eliminate human error.\n",
    "\n",
    "By addressing these points, the Ultraman system's accuracy and reliability can be significantly enhanced, leading to more reliable and valuable tribological testing results.\n"

      "The interfacial heat transfer coeﬃcient (IHTC) is an important thermophysical parameter in hot stampingprocesses and must be identiﬁed not only to retain the full mechanical strength of formed components, but alsoto optimise the production rate. In this work, a novel experimental facility was developed and applied tomeasure the temperature evolutions of the specimens and tools in stamping processes. Simulated temperatureevolutions obtained using the FE software PAM-STAMP were then ﬁt to this data. The IHTC values between AA7075 and three diﬀerent tool materials were characterized at di ﬀerent contact pressures under both dry and lubricated conditions. In addition, a mechanism based IHTC model was developed and validated as a function ofcontact pressure, tool material and lubricant thickness to predict the IHTC values under di ﬀerent conditions.\n",
      "1. IntroductionThe characteristic properties of aluminium alloys, e.g.high strength- weight ratio, high thermal conductance, good corrosion resistance andgood recyclability, render them ideal materials to ful ﬁl the rapidly growing demand for light-weight vehicles to reduce carbon emissionsand improve fuel economies. Their low formability at room tempera-ture, however, limits the applications of aluminium alloys in theautomotive industry.In recent years, hot stamping was developed as a promisingtechnology to form sheet metal components at elevated temperatures.Solution Heat treatment, Forming and in-die Quenching (HFQ\n",
      "1) is one such novel sheet metal forming technology for manufacturing largecomplex-shaped and thin-walled components ( Foster et al., 2013). The metal blank isﬁrstly heated up to its solution heat treatment (SHT)temperature, and then formed and quenched simultaneously by colddies at a high forming speed to obtain a supersaturated solid solution(SSSS), which provides a high post-form strength after arti ﬁcial ageing (Garrett et al., 2005). In order to retain the full mechanical strength ofthe material during ageing processes that follow forming, the quench-ing rate during the hot stamping process must be above the criticalcooling rate such that no solute elements precipitate out as coarseparticles (Milkereit et al., 2009). The interfacial heat transfer coe ﬃ-cient, an important thermophysical parameter in hot stamping pro-cesses, such as HFQ, should therefore be identiﬁed not only to retain the full mechanical strength of formed components by achieving the criticalquenching rates for diﬀerent aluminium alloys (Liu et al., 2015), but also to optimise the production rate by controlling the quenchingprocess. Furthermore, the critical quenching rates and the correspond-ing critical contact pressures are beneﬁcial for guiding the tool design, in order to avoid insuﬃcient quenching in particular regions, e.g.vertical walls, sharp corners, and thus providing a high post-formstrength after artiﬁcial ageing.Great eﬀorts have been made previously to measure interfacialtemperature evolutions and determine IHTC values. In Chang et al.'s (2016)hot stamping experiments, 22MnB5 specimens were heated tothe target temperature of 900 °C and soaked for 3 min. The specimenswere then quickly transferred onto a lower die and compressed by anupper die, which were both made of AISI 1045 tool steel, and theirtemperature evolutions recorded. In Bai et al.’s (2012)hot forging experiments of Ti-6Al–4 V, specimens were placed between a lower andan upper die, which were made of H13 steel. The specimens wereheated by a furnace to the target temperature and then compressedbetween two dies heated by a band heater, while temperature historieswere recorded by pairs of thermocouples. Similar compression equip-ment was also applied byYukawa et al. (2014). Once heated to their\n",

      "target temperatures and soaked for diﬀerent periods of times, the specimens made of carbon steel, were moved onto a heat insulating dieand compressed by a heat conducting punch. The temperature evolu-tions of the punch were measured and recorded using thermocouplesembedded in the punch.In order to identify the IHTC under speciﬁc experimental condi- tions, the measured temperature evolutions were compared with thoseinversely calculated with Beck ’s non-linear estimation method (Caron et al., 2014), or with those predicted by formulations using a 1D closedform method (Bai et al., 2012). Additionally, FE simulations (run inABAQUS (Ji et al., 2014), PAM-STAMP (Liu et al., 2015) or DEFORM- 2D (Yukawa et al., 2014)) were applied to obtain simulated tempera-ture evolutions toﬁt the experimental curves to identify the corre-sponding IHTC values.Several studies have also investigated factors, e.g. contact pressure,tool material and lubricant, inﬂuencing the IHTC in metal formingprocesses. The power increasing trend of IHTC with contact pressurewas obtained byChang et al. (2016)for hot stamping of 22MnB5 steel.The IHTC was observed to increase from 0 kW/m\n",
      "2K at 0 MPa to around 4.5 kW/m\n",
      "2K at 30 MPa. The result of the exponential increasing trendof IHTC with contact pressure was observed in the study by Bai et al. (2012)of Ti-6Al–4 V andYukawa et al. (2014)of carbon steel. The eﬀect of tool material has been characterised in Chang et al.'s (2016) study, in which 22MnB5 blanks were stamped by AISI1045 steel andH13 tool steel respectively. The thermo-physical properties e.g. thethermal conductivity and speciﬁc heat capacity, of 1045 tool steel arehigher than that of H13 tool steel, contributing to higher IHTC values.Hu et al. (2013)investigated the IHTC in hot stamping between22MnB5 blanks and H11 tools, which have thermophysical propertyvalues, and subsequently IHTC values, between those of 1045 and H13tool steels (Chang et al., 2016).Hu et al. (1998)also found that the peak IHTC of 2.5 kW/m\n",

      "2K) under the same conditions (Bai et al., 2012). The eﬀect of lubricant has been investi-gated inBurte et al.'s (1990)study, in which graphite in watersuspension was applied as a lubricant between aluminium alloy 2024-0 and H13 tool steel. The lubricant raised the IHTC values from 1.8 to6 kW/m\n",
      "2K at 0.85 MPa and from 9 to 18 kW/m2K at 150 MPa. This positive eﬀect of lubricant on the IHTC was also observed in the studybyFoster et al. (2008)of AA6082 using four diﬀerent lubricants and by Jain, (1990)for Al1100-O using MoS\n",
      "2as a lubricant. However, the reverse eﬀect was found inZhang et al.'s (2010)research, in which glass was used as a lubricant.The IHTC therefore depends on the contact pressure, the material ofthe contact bodies and the lubricant. In order to predict its value,Çetinkale and Fishenden, (1951) ’sequation is widely used to estimatethe general heat transfer coeﬃcient, as shown in Eq.(1).\n",

Thefacility, designed with interchangeable components, streamlines theprocess by which the IHTC between diﬀerent combinations of blank and tool materials could be determined. The IHTC value was subsequentlyfound by utilising an inverse technique toﬁt the experimental data to simulated temperature evolutions obtained using the FE software PAM-STAMP. The capabilities of the IHTC test facility are demonstrated hereby using it to investigate the eﬀect of contact pressure and lubricant onthe IHTC between a hot AA7075 specimen and three di ﬀerent tools. In addition, an IHTC model was developed as a function of contactpressure, tool material and lubricant to predict their e ﬀect on the IHTC, and validated using the results of hot stamping tests of ahemispherical dome shape and B pillar component.2. Methodology2.1. Design of the IHTC test facilityThe IHTC test facility, a schematic for which is shown in Fig. 1, was developed to simulate hot stamping processes. Three sets of punchesand dies were available, made from three diﬀerent tool steels, i.e. H13, cast iron and P20, with contact surfaces of 50 × 25 mm\n",
      "2. The average surface roughnesses of H13, cast iron and P20 tools were 980, 810 and960 nm respectively, and were measured using White Light Interfero-metry equipment (Wyko NT9100). A specimen (No. 1 in Fig. 1) was screwed onto two blankholders (No. 4 in Fig. 1), and heated using direct resistance heating, then compressed against a ﬁxed die (No. 3 in Fig. 1) by a moving punch (No. 2 inFig. 1).During these temperature/pressure-sensitive IHTC tests, the com-pressive loads were only able to reach the target value in 0.3 s aftercompression was initiated, with an approximate 20 °C temperature lossin the samples; this was accounted for when comparing with thesimulation results. Variable heating and cooling can be realised in boththe test facility and in the simulations to represent particular processes,e.g. multi-paint cycles. Variable loads and stamping speeds can becontrolled accurately, which can also be assigned in simulations tosimulate diﬀerent forming processes, e.g. warm/hot stamping.The IHTC test facility provides a high stability and repeatability inthe test results. Speciﬁcally, the specimens were controlled precisely tobe compressed at the centre of the tools in each test with a tolerance of0.1 mm, thus ensuring that the heat transfer between the specimen andX.

      "159\n",
      "tools was in three dimensions and symmetric. Additionally, the speci-mens were heated by direct resistance heating from their respectivetops and bottoms simultaneously, ensuring a high temperature homo-geneity in the compression region. The measured temperature di ﬀer- ence between the centre and edges of the compression regions in thespecimens was within 5 °C. After heating, the IHTC test facility alsodoes not necessitate the transfer of the specimens from a furnace to apress machine. Therefore, the punch, which only takes 0.05 s tocompress the specimens at a speed of 400 mm/s, could be actuatedimmediately after heating, ensuring a negligible temperature loss fromthe specimens. The initial temperature of both the punch and die couldalso be considered as being equivalent when the compression processwas started.2.2. Experimental proceduresPrior to each test, a 120 × 10 × 2 mm\n",
      "3AA7075 specimen supplied by AMAG Austria Metal AG in the T6 condition, was screwed onto theblankholders and positioned between the punch and die. The averagesurface roughness of the specimens was 340 nm and the composition ofAA7075-T6 is shown inTable 1. In order to monitor temperature, pairsof thermocouples were embedded mid-thickness at the centre of thespecimen, and at a distance of 3 mm below the centre of the tool (punchand die) contact surfaces respectively, and then connected to a datalogger.To represent a hot stamping process, the specimen was ﬁrstly heated by direct electrical resistance heating to its SHT temperature, 490 °C, ata heating rate of 10 °C/s, while the temperature of the tools wasmaintained at room temperature. Once the target temperature wasreached, the punch was instantly actuated to move towards the speci-men at a speed of 400 mm/s and compress it against the die at di ﬀerent pre-deﬁned contact pressures. After the compression, the punch wasmoved back to its initial position. The temperature evolutions of thespecimen and the tools were recorded throughout the compressionprocess. Prior to each test for the lubricated condition studies, grease-based graphite was applied with great care onto the tool surfaces only,which were thoroughly cleaned by using a chemical etchant after eachtest. The applied layer thickness of lubricant was precisely measured byusing dedicated equipment.2.3. FE simulation proceduresIn order to simulate temperature evolutions of the specimen andtools, a FE model was built up in PAM-STAMP, which enablesmodelling of the interactions between mechanical and thermal ﬁelds (Karbasian and Tekkaya, 2010) and that can model heat transfer in 3D.The dimensions of the specimen and tools were the same as those usedin the IHTC test facility, as shown in Fig. 2. The material properties of the specimen were generated by using empirical ﬁttings as a function of temperature in Kelvin (Johnson, 2004), and the material properties ofthe three tools were based on a professional online material informationresource (MatWeb, 2016), and are shown inTable 2. Explicit quadrangle thermal shell elements with two degrees offreedom in temperature were used for the specimen to precisely representthe heat transfer mechanism that occurs during the hot stamping process.The selected element size, 2 mm, ensured that the temperature at thecentre of the specimen could be captured accurately while providing areasonable computational time. The same element type and size wereselected for the majority of the regions on the tools, whilst explicittriangle thermal shell elements were used for some regions near circularedges. The total number of elements of the specimen (No.1 in Fig. 2), punch/die (No.2 & 3 inFig. 2), blankholders (No.4 inFig. 2)a n ds c r e w s (No.5 inFig. 2) were 240, 325, 634 and 216 respectively.‘Hotforming double action validation ’was selected as the simulation\n",

All six degrees offreedom were restricted for the die, whilst all degrees of freedom,except for that in the z-direction (direction of punch motion), wererestricted for the punch, blankholders and screws. The specimen wasable to deform in all degrees of freedom. In the gravity and holdingstages, the specimen was located and held by the blankholders andscrews. In the subsequent stamping and quenching stages, the punchmoved towards the specimen at the same speed as that in theexperiments and compressed it against the die for 4 s.Prior to the quenching stage, the actual measured temperature fromthe experiments at the two ends of the specimen was 310 °C, due to theheat transfer to the blankholders, whilst the temperature distributionwithin the compression region was uniform. Therefore, the initialtemperature of the tools, the two ends of the specimen and the centreof the specimen were set as 25, 310 and 490 °C respectively. Di ﬀering from the experiments, a diﬀerent constant IHTC value was assigned foreach simulation to eliminate the eﬀect of contact pressure on the temperature evolution. The temperature evolutions, at identical loca-tions to those in the experiments, were then plotted and compared withthe experimental temperature evolutions. The experimental and simu-lated curves with the best agreement indicated that the IHTC assignedin that simulation was the corresponding value at the selected experi-mental conditions.Fig. 3shows a comparison of the temperature evolutions obtainedfrom a simulation assigned an IHTC value of 9.2 kW/m2K and from an experiment with a contact pressure of 3 MPa under dry conditions,using cast iron tools. From the results, it was found that the temperatureof the specimen dropped drastically in theﬁrst 2s, while the punch temperature increased gradually with time. The experimental tempera-ture evolutions agree well with the simulated curves, which indicatesthat the IHTC value is 9.2 kW/m\n",

      "2K when the contact pressure increases from 0 to 7 MPaunder dry conditions, followed by a gentle increase as the contactpressure increases from 7 to 10 MPa. When the contact pressure ishigher than 13 MPa, a plateau of the IHTC is observed, with value ofapproximately 8.6 kW/m\n",
      "2K. The variation of the IHTC values can beexplained by the evolutions of real contact area at di ﬀerent contact pressures. The real contact area between the specimen and tools isusually much less than the apparent contact area, and increases withincreasing contact pressure due to the variation of the specimen surfacecondition (Buchner et al., 2009). This is beneﬁcial for the interfacial heat transfer between the specimen and the tools, leading to an increasein the IHTC with increasing contact pressure.In order to characterise the relationship between the real contactarea and contact pressure, the average surface roughness of the H13tools and the specimens were measured after the IHTC tests. Theaverage surface roughness of the H13 tools remained stable at 980 nmthroughout the experiments, whilst for the specimen this value variedwith the contact pressure. The strength of H13 within the temperaturerange used in the experiments was much larger than that of AA7075 atelevated temperatures. As a result, the surfaces of the specimens weredeformed by the tools during the hot stamping processes and thus thesurface roughness of the specimens increased correspondingly.Therefore, the real contact area was growing due to the fact that thetwo contact surfaces were increasingly meshed together.

      "Fig. 5, the surface roughness of the specimen increases slightly from340 to 380 nm as the contact pressure increases from 0 to 5 MPa.During this stage, deformations occur at the surface of the specimen andthereby the real contact area increases. After the experiments, theelastic deformations recover but the plastic deformations remain. As aresult, the surface roughness of the specimen increases slightly, butresults in a rapid growth of the IHTC value. After yielding, the surfaceroughness increases dramatically from 380 nm at 5 MPa to 860 nm at10 MPa, and correspondingly the IHTC value continues to grow rapidly.When the pressure is larger than 10 MPa, the surface roughness of thespecimen increases gently to 910 nm, approaching the value for that ofthe H13 tools. During this stage, the two contact surfaces are meshed tothe maximum extent and thus the real contact area reaches its peak.Consequently, a plateau of the IHTC is observed.In general, the critical quenching rate for AA7XXX alloys is above50 °C/s and this value is alloying element dependent, i.e. a highercritical quenching rate is required for an increasing content of alloyingelements. Through superimposing the quenching curves obtained fromthe experimental temperature evolutions with the continuous coolingtransformation (CCT) diagrams for the present aluminium alloy, therequired contact pressure to achieve the critical cooling rate couldtherefore be identiﬁed. An excessive contact pressure could also beprevented from being applied between the two contact surfaces byaccounting for the plateau value of the IHTC. This would be bene ﬁcial to the reduction of tool wear, the extension of tool service life and thepromotion of cost eﬃciency in hot stamping processes.\n",

      "3.2. Eﬀect of tool material on IHTCWhen cast iron tools were applied, the overall evolution of the IHTCunder dry conditions followed a similar trend to that of H13 tools, i.e. asharp increase at the initial stage, followed by a plateau at high contactpressures, as shown inFig. 4. Speciﬁcally, the IHTC increases drama- tically from 0.8 kW/m\n",
      "2K at 0 MPa to 14 kW/m2K at 7 MPa. When the contact pressure reaches 13 MPa, the IHTC converges to a value of15.1 kW/m\n",
      "2K. The application of cast iron tools increases the peakIHTC value by approximately 76%, compared to when H13 tools wereused. Within the temperature range used in the experiments, theaverage thermal conductivity of cast iron, 0.044 kW/mK, is approxi-mately 80% higher than that of H13, which is 0.0244 kW/mK, as showninTable 1. This indicates that the heat transfer occurs at a higher rateacross cast iron tools than across H13 tools, thus leading to the greaterIHTC values. The diﬀerence in the speciﬁc heat capacity between H13 (460 J/kgK) and cast iron (465 J/kgK) is negligible in this study. Itwould therefore be desirable to deduce the inﬂuence of the thermal conductivity of the diﬀerent tools on their resulting diﬀerent IHTC values. This inﬂuence could be veriﬁed by the study ofLiu et al. (2015) in which the peak IHTC value for AA7075 under dry conditions whenusing mild steel tools, 12.3 kW/m\n",
      "2K, lies between the peak valuesobtained when using H13 and cast iron tools, and the thermalconductivity of mild steel is in between both H13 and cast iron.The temperature distributions in specimens and tools, either uni-form or tailored, play a very important role in hot stamping processes,inﬂuencing the post-form strength and thickness distribution of theformed component. The application of diﬀerent contact pressures and diﬀerent materials in speciﬁc regions of tools are notable and inﬂuen- tial factors that could achieve desired temperature distributions. Toolmaterials with a high thermal conductivity, e.g. cast iron, can be usedfor the punch and die for manufacturing quenching rate sensitivematerials. Meanwhile, materials with a low thermal conductivity, e.g.H13, can be used for blankholders to prevent the temperature of aspecimen from dropping signiﬁcantly in the blankholding regions of aforming tool during forming, thus enabling more material to be drawninto the tool cavity.Compared with previous research, the IHTC values of AA7075,using either H13 or cast iron tools, are much higher than those of Ti-6Al–4 V, 22MnB5 steel and carbon steel, thus resulting in much shorterrequired quenching times for hot stamping processes. In addition, thecontact pressure values at which the IHTC value plateaus, using eitherH13 or cast iron tools, are much lower than those of titanium alloys andhigh strength steels, due to the lower strength of aluminium alloys atelevated temperatures. This desirable feature would reduce the require-ments of the capabilities of the forming press, and extend the tool life.3.3. Eﬀect of lubricant on IHTCWhen a grease-based graphite lubricant was applied onto thesurfaces of cast iron tools, the overall evolution of the IHTC followedan exponentially increasing trend. As shown in Fig. 6, when the applied lubricant layer thickness is 0.015 mm, the IHTC increases dramaticallyfrom 3 kW/m2K at 0 MPa to 19 kW/m2K at 7 MPa. When the contact pressure reaches 13 MPa, the IHTC converges to a value of 22 kW/m\n",
      "2K. The application of lubricant increases the peak IHTC values byapproximately 46%, compared to that under dry conditions, using castiron tools. The thermal conductivity of the grease-based graphitelubricant is 0.024 kW/mK, which is much higher than that of air, thusthe heatﬂow is much more rapid when the lubricantﬁlls up the vacancies of the asperities at the contact interface. In addition, thegraphite lubricant is able to dissipate more heat to accelerate the heattransfer.The evolutions of the IHTC are also determined as a function of theapplied lubricant layer thickness at diﬀerent contact pressures, as shown inFig. 7. When the contact pressure is 5 MPa, the IHTC increasesdramatically from 12.6 to 16.5 kW/mK when the applied lubricantlayer thickness increases from 0 to 0.015 mm. The IHTC then remainsstable when the thickness is larger than 0.015 mm. The same trend canbe observed at a contact pressure of 10 MPa, i.e. as the appliedlubricant layer thickness increases, a steep increase followed by aplateau of the IHTC values is observed. The IHTC value is larger whenmore lubricantﬁlls up the vacancies at the contact interface. However,the excessive lubricant is squeezed out of the contact area by the toolswhen the lubricant thickness is greater than 0.015 mm at both contactpressures of 5 and 10 MPa, indicating that this value is the maximumeﬀective applied lubricant layer thickness.Contrary to the previous research (Zhang et al., 2010) conducted using glass as a lubricant, the application of grease-based graphitelubricant has a positive inﬂuence on the IHTC. It is due to the fact thatthe thermal conductivity of the grease-based graphite lubricant(0.024 kW/mK) is much larger than that of the glass lubricant(0.00125 kW/mK). Consequently, the heat transfer between the contactsolids is much more rapid and the heat loss is signi ﬁcantly less when\n",

      "using the graphite lubricant. Therefore, the application of a lubricantwith a higher thermal conductivity would result in higher IHTC valuesand thus a shorter required quenching time for hot stamping processes.The critical contact pressure and friction would thereby be reduced,extending the tool life. Excessive lubricant could also be prevented frombeing applied. Overall, these features would be bene ﬁcial to the promotion of cost eﬃciency in hot stamping processes.4. Development of a mechanism based IHTC modelThe results obtained using the IHTC test facility at di ﬀerent contact pressures and for diﬀerent tool materials under both dry and lubricatedconditions were used to develop a deﬁ nition of the overall IHTC between the specimen and tools, derived from the null-pressure IHTCh\n",

Meanwhile, two new testswere conducted under the same conditions as those of the simulationsusing the IHTC test facility. As shown in Fig. 9, it is evident that the simulated temperature evolutions were in close agreement with theexperimental curves, indicating that when using P20 tools, the IHTCvalues at 3 MPa under dry conditions and at 13 MPa under lubricatedconditions with a layer thickness value of 0.015 mm, are 6.7 and14.5 kW/m\n",

      "for the specimens, tools and lubricant, the IHTC evolution comprisestwo stages; a rapidly increasing stage due to the introduction of thecontact pressure, and a stable stage due to the achievement of theconvergent contact pressure value at which the IHTC becomes constant.If specimens and tools with higher thermal conductivity values areused, the corresponding IHTC evolutions will have higher values due toa greater amount of heat transfer between the two contact solids.Fig. 10shows IHTC evolutions as a function of the thermal conductivityof the tool and specimen, predicted by the IHTC model, at a constantcontact pressure of 15 MPa and surface roughness of 810 and 340 nmfor the tool and specimen respectively, under dry and lubricated(0.02 mm layer thickness) conditions. The IHTC values for AA7075using tools with a greater thermal conductivity than that of cast irontools, e.g. AISI 1045 tool steel, will therefore be higher. When using castiron tools, the IHTC values for some aluminium alloys with a smallerthermal conductivity than that of AA7075, e.g. AA5083, will thus belower under the same conditions. In addition, the application oflubricant enhances the IHTC values, indicating that using tools with alower thermal conductivity, e.g. H13 tools, under lubricated conditionscould achieve similar results to using tools with a higher thermalconductivity, e.g. cast iron tools, under dry conditions. This featurewould be beneﬁcial to the reduction of the requirements of the formingpress capabilities, as lower contact pressures could consequently beapplied.Theoretically, this model is also able to predict the e ﬀect of surface roughness on the IHTC evolutions.Fig. 11shows the IHTC evolutions as a function of the surface roughness of the tool and specimen, predictedby the IHTC model, at a constant contact pressure of 15 MPa andthermal conductivities of 0.0244 and 0.14 kW/mK for the tool andspecimen respectively, under dry conditions.

As discussed earlier,the surface roughness of the specimen approaches the value of that forthe tools during a hot stamping process, due to the higher strength ofthe tools. The initial surface roughness of the tools before stamping istherefore crucial, whereas the value for the specimen has a marginaleﬀect on the IHTC. The meshing between the two contact surfacesdecreases with the increasing initial surface roughness of tools. Conse-quently, the real contact area and the IHTC values decrease. Thesepredictions agree with the previous theoretical analysis.5. Hot stamping validation tests5.1.

Once the blank temperature dropped to around 430 °C, thetop blankholder was instantly actuated to move towards the blank andcompress it against the bottom blankholder. The blankholding forcewas maintained by two gas springs at a constant value of 20 kn. Thecompressed blankholders continuously moved towards the cold staticdie at a speed of 75 mm/s to deform the blank to a dome height of10 mm. After a 20 s quenching period, the top and bottom blankholderswere returned to their initial positions. During the B pillar test, the hotblank was transferred quickly onto the blankholder after heating andsoaking. When the temperature of the blank decreased to 430 °C, thepunch was moved towards the static cold die immediately, compressingthe blank against the blankholder at a constant blankholding force of20 kn and subsequently deforming it into a B pillar shaped componentat a stamping speed of 75 mm/s. The punch and the blankholder werethen returned after a 20 s quenching stage.5.2. FE simulation procedures for the validation testsIn order to simulate the hemispherical dome and B pillar formingtests, FE models for both were developed in PAM-STAMP. The dimen-sions of the blanks and tools were the same as those used in theexperiments, as shown inFigs. 12 and 13. Explicit quadrangle thermalshell elements with a size of 2 mm were used for the blanks in both thehemispherical dome and B pillar FE simulations, which were identicalto those used in the IHTC FE simulations. The initial temperature of theblank for both FE simulations was set as 430 °C, and the predicted IHTCevolutions with contact pressure using P20 tools and lubricatedconditions were implemented in both FE simulations.5.3.
